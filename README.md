For the last few years, I have been working outside of the tech world. While it gave me valuable life and business experience, I always felt something was missing - the thrill of working with data, logic, and problem-solving.

So earlier this year, I made a decision:

 👉 To return to my tech career.
 👉 To rebuild my skills from the ground up.
 👉 And to prove my abilities through real projects, not just theory.

One of the first projects I completed was a SQL based data analytics project, modeled on a real-world business case in the shipping industry.

The shipping industry is one of the backbones of global trade - but it also faces massive challenges:

⛽ Rising fuel costs 
🌱 Pressure to reduce CO₂ emissions 
📊 Optimizing voyage efficiency 

I wanted to replicate this business challenge in a data environment and see what insights I could generate using SQL.

Kaggle - Volume (~2.5 𝙡𝙖𝙠𝙝 𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙨) covering 5 Yrs (2020–2024) data.

🛠 𝙏𝙚𝙘𝙝 & 𝘼𝙥𝙥𝙧𝙤𝙖𝙘𝙝

📌MySQL 8.0 
📌Data import using LOAD LOCAL DATA INFILE.
📌Designed schema with foreign key relationships (Ships ↔ Routes ↔ Voyages).
📌Wrote 25 SQL queries ranging from:
➡️Basic SELECTs and aggregations
➡️Joins across multiple tables
➡️Window functions (ranking, running totals, moving averages)
➡️Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
➡️Date-based analytics (month, quarter, year trends)

⛴ Tankers were the least efficient, consuming ~20% more fuel per km than cargo ships.

📈 Voyage volumes increased steadily year-on-year (2020 → 2024), with seasonal peaks in Q3 (global trade cycles).

🌍 A small number of long-haul routes (~5%) accounted for 40% of total CO₂ emissions — classic Pareto principle at play.

⚓ Older ships (built before 2005) consumed significantly more fuel (+25%) compared to newer vessels, proving the impact of modernization.

🕒 Average voyage duration dropped slightly post-2022, suggesting better route planning and fleet optimization.

It gave me hands-on experience with large datasets (~2.5 lakh rows) far beyond conceptual examples. It reinforced my ability to bridge business problems with data-driven solutions.

For me, this project is more than just SQL. It’s a symbol of:

𝙍𝙚𝙨𝙞𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚: Choosing to come back into tech after a gap.
𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙮: Practicing daily, building datasets, solving queries.
𝙂𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙩𝙝: Upskilling with modern SQL concepts & business thinking.
